After reading <i>Dai Yi Ben Shu Qu Ba Li</i>, I would understand the importance of France in Paris. Although there is the famous French city of Nice, Provence and other cities, but these cities can not be compared with Paris. The geographical center of Paris, though not in France, but they are the French cultural center and spiritual center. As we all know, the European continent happened countless times of war, as one of the great powers on the European continent, France is also involved in a variety of war, the French land was conquered many times, however, because the French saved Paris, so France also survived.
</p>
<img src="France-eiffle tower.JPG" alt="Eiffel Tower" id = "France_photo"/>
<p>
Before I came to Paris, France impression there are many, for example, France is synonymous with romance: kissing couple seen on the streets; the French romantic, beautiful lavender and the romantic French dinner. I also know that French football is very powerful, elementary school watched Zidane led France into the World Cup soccer finals, the final in a penalty shootout regret losing. Speaking of sports, without mentioning the French Open on clay. Although French is one of the four Grand Slam, but I really started to pay attention from Li Na won the French Open is the beginning of that. As a Chinese person, Li Na in their own way to demonstrate the true meaning of patriotism. Then the French cuisine, although previously mentioned, but here would like to elaborate on it. I understand French roast snails and foie gras. Foie gras only in film and television drama seen, he did not have tasted snails eat at Pizza Hut, I feel good. Because I like to watch television cooking competition class, you know French Michelin restaurants along with a Michelin-starred chef. The final step is for the interest of France, especially in Paris heard some of the attractions: the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Louvre and the like. After staying for five days in Paris, I have a deeper understanding of Paris, found that I had the impression of Paris is mostly in line with the facts, but relatively superficial.
</p>
<p>
Paris public transport system has left me a deep impression. Because I live in the suburbs of Paris, the city actually not in Paris, be it big in Paris, so every day I have to go out and tour the metro. Completely lost in the first day subway clue, I took the wrong three times, wasted about two hours. Paris mainly because there is no stop sign in English, I did not do your homework before you go, so the language barrier has become very prominent; Second, part of the Paris metro (suburban railway) not just in two directions, nor is annular. Originally thought and Beijing are similar, but later found the Paris Metro is much more complex than Beijing, which has a station can have four or five lines cross together, take the time to go for a long time, but also to climb up and down. Those with more than two lines will show the direction of each train is destined direction on the electronic bulletin board inside the station. Before coming also lived in France, specialized and friends talked about this topic, she said that the bus system is not so complicated, as long as two to figure out the general direction of the line on the line. The fact that she did not say so simple. Even if only a line in three directions (terminal), passengers need to look up an electronic monitor to confirm the destination of each train.
</p>
<p>
I later compared to Switzerland, Austria, the cultural and historical attractions in Paris is the most appealing to me. Although Vienna is also the 18th and 19th century church, Lucerne 16th-century bridge, but Paris has 850-year history of Notre Dame, a big finish to-day visit Louvre, Versailles extremely luxurious garden. I'm not saying Switzerland, Austria attractions no meaning, but is dwarfed compared to Paris. For example, the Louvre Museum is all I've been currently one of the best, even better than the British Museum. So when I went to the Swiss National Museum in Switzerland, Austria Belvedere Museum of Art, I was shocked very little feeling. So I would suggest to go to Paris to play the best people to travel to Paris on the back, so there will be a whole novel, I was shocked feeling! Like I see a man in poor written advice online travel: If you go to Versailles and the Louvre, be sure to go to Versailles. On the one hand because of the Palace of Versailles and the Louvre different temperament, it is more inclined to exaggerate, to show off; the other is the Louvre to be more luxurious atmosphere. Overall, there are many fun attractions in Paris, and each one is different. Religious classics such as Notre Dame Cathedral, museums like the Louvre, there is such a palace of Versailles, there is the monument to the Arc de Triomphe, Eiffel Tower such architectural landscape, there is this kind of Champs Elysees shopping paradise . . . I was in and out of Paris five days before leaving hurriedly finished visiting the Pantheon, considered the trip to Paris to draw a full stop, but I had to give up almost every day attractions, temporarily modify the itinerary. After all, travel is your thing, so where to go sightseeing all depends on your interests. Nothing of interest is a must go, but the most famous of all tours are of interest to it there is also good place worth going. In short, if you go to Paris for the first time, at least to wait five days.
</p>
<p>
Parisians think, I first thought of this topic is English. I'm ready mentally prepared before I heard the French in particular, English is not good, or some say even if they speak English and you will speak French. Before departure I expected that other European countries may not have a lot of English speaking people, could only student said. He then went to Switzerland, Austria, then Germany, then come back to contrast French English, they are indeed the worst of English proficiency. Before departure, I often asked my summer program, the problem is much the same, for example, to which countries? What project? For how long? There are no friends to go? When I repeated again and again the same answer, I suddenly discovered that many people have been to Europe a. I know three friends have been to Switzerland, but also in the French school, the students lived for four years. I specifically asked the students lived in Paris, French English how. She claims the people's national pride is very strong, even if they speak English, they will tendencies and you speak French. She also told me she arrived in France a story. She just will not go when French should be some English. Sometimes she would like to seek help French people, the French are always in the street to say French, even after she expressed themselves in English did not understand the French people still insist on speaking French. In those French attempt failed many times, they started than the hands and feet. At this point my friend did not understand. The last Frenchman finally speak English. For this story, I also hear the dialectical acceptable, I think my friend telling her story inevitably exaggerated ingredients. But the next day I went to Paris, I encountered a similar scene. I think I live in a small inn offers breakfast, because the first floor of the hotel is a restaurant. I found the front desk to ask a French breakfast is open from a few to a few. Fortunately, he seemed to understand my problem. First, he answered me in French. I could not understand a word, shook his head. He had to watch into his hands and feet while ratio, and then look to me and expect me to understand. I'm still little understood. I thought he was trying to tell me breakfast from 10:00 to 18:00. Then I thought, this can not ah! Is 6 am to 10 pm, compare this explanation make sense. But I'm pretty sure he was referring to the first 10, and then refer to 6. However, in my story, there is that last link, that is, the French began to speak English. Because I find that about 50 young French people, might not have learned English, even learned, you may also have to forget about it. Because I know he has tried, but I still can not understand him than the hands and feet, so in the end I had to perfunctory say OK, I understand. Until that night, when I found out that the restaurant does not serve breakfast, I realized he meant the restaurant offers lunch beginning at 10:30. It turned out he did not understand what I was asking him a few breakfast began.
</p>
<p>
When France, I found a very French love reading, especially good use of trivial time reading, such as reading on the subway. When I first subway in Paris especially surprised they have almost no one to play phone, in stark contrast with the Chinese people's behavior in the subway. Later Every time I take the subway, I deliberately observed the French school, I found them on a subway took out a book that has been read off. Once I sat next to a young woman, hands only took about 30 cm long a ladies handbag, she opened the car moves after the zipper bag, and take things from there. Although I had already found that the French love reading, but in that situation, taking into account the size of her handbag, I prefer to believe that she will come up with a mobile phone, rather than a book. The results she took out a pocket book in a plastic bag inside. I glanced at her a package, in addition to the book, the bag is almost nothing else. If you are in Beijing, people come up after the subway is definitely the phone, rather than a book. I tried to excuse us Chinese people, our subway is very crowded, do not bring books. But think about it, it is true, Beijing's subway during rush hour on a really crowded, but at other times is entirely possible reading. I think this is reflected in the difference between Chinese and French mentality: the French people very quiet, is possible only in the subway reading the kind of environment in the state was calm inside. In contrast, the Chinese people to be more impetuous. Chinese people, especially young people spend a lot of time every day to brush micro letter, brush circle of friends. All the time concerned about the lives of others, living in someone else's world. And this is a vicious circle, the circle of friends of the brush, the more boring and impetuous, less likely to read. To return to the topic, on the subway reading the Chinese people very few. I remember about two years ago, when I was preparing for the exam abroad, need to learn many words, I developed a trivial use all the time back word habits. No matter where to go, I took a book of words every day. Once in the subway when the word back, an aunt took the initiative to offer me a seat, he told me that now too few people reading, reading should be given one seat. I do not know I was there blush, because I could not see his face, but I am ashamed. On the one hand because I did not study, I do not think the word back be reading; on the other hand because the aunt said is absolutely correct, as a Chinese, I am ashamed.
</p>
<p>
Because this travel is not coherent, the distance I have to go to Paris for some time. My memories of Paris has been somewhat blurred. However, I still clearly remember the long history of Notre Dame, the Eiffel Tower into the sky I remember, I remember the luxury of Versailles, of course, remember the countless treasures of the Louvre. In retrospect, very glad to have chosen Paris depth tour of the week, rather than fly a week to play 2-3 cities, and even countries with the mission to go 3-4. Paris would like to say the building, but I'm not an expert in this area, can not tell what the baroque, rococo what, what neoclassical. I can only say, in Paris there are a variety of buildings, such as Notre Dame magnificent classical building with a modern industrial atmosphere of the Eiffel Tower so thick steel Giants, also the Louvre such as modern, but also temperament palace building. I remember reading in the book, in the 18th and 19th centuries, Paris has undergone a major urban renewal area, many buildings demolished, and many buildings were built. Now before you can see the reconstruction of the district is running out, the Marais is one of them. But I am very envious of Paris, because their Master Planner, who was the monarch still retains a respect and respect for the history of culture. Although they rebuilt the city, the new building still continues the style of hundreds of years ago, rather than Beijing, as all the old buildings are torn down, built a bunch of weird buildings, and even built some final fake ancient architecture. I just want to ask, if the Government is to restore a false Qianmen Street, why it was demolished it? Qianmen Street is now a ghost street at night.
</p>
<p>
In making the trip to Paris is one of my favorite cities. If I had to choose a city to be a very long time, I would choose Paris.
</p>
</div>
<div id = "Switzerland">
<h2><ul><li>Switzerland</li></ul></h2>
<p>
I do not have much impression of Switzerland. Compared to those of the smallest countries in Europe, such as Liechtenstein, the Vatican, Switzerland is not small, but it is in the international political arena and there is no right to speak, and I heard you say that it is a neutral country. In short, compared to the huge China, Switzerland is indeed "not worth mentioning." Later, after the decision to go to Switzerland, but also from all parties understand some information about Switzerland, such as Swiss cities tend to be more clean, people very rich.
</p>
<p>
He came to Switzerland, the Swiss people impressed. Swiss always anxious busy, always very serene look. They do not have Chinese people impetuous. I almost did not see the time at which the Swiss man walking in a hurry, or catch the bus to run and jump. In short, I am very envious of their mentality. What are the reasons leading the Chinese people and the Swiss mentality contrast it? Relatively superficial answer may be that they mean highly educated, wealthy citizens, less of the total population, and so on. For this problem, I do not have very deep answer. But I think this may be because the pursuit of different, and this is a social dimension of the problem, because whether it is calm or irritable state of mind is contagious. A common phenomenon in China is: on the bus, because too many people, pushing and shoving is inevitable, but often hear bad attitude passengers blame the driver, other passengers complain. Next, the car will be a domino effect all become anxious. Suppose a car is only one easy anxious passengers, his bad mood is not easily transmitted to others, on the contrary, his mood is likely to calm down in a quiet environment.
</p>
<p>
In Switzerland, I had the honor and the two Swiss have more in-depth exchanges. And communicate with local people has always been my view, the most important travel component, which is one of the best way to learn about the local culture. I was in Zurich for the first time in life to try breakfast and bed (BnB), that is, those products has been a very fire Air bnb sales. It was a villa in the suburbs, although able to get 10 minutes out there stop, but overall, the location of the house is not very convenient. The landlord is very warm, she was a middle-aged, buxom lady. She always smiled, always put the "super" mention. If the accommodation compared to a hotel stay, I definitely give this service to play out. She chatted for a few found mainly speaks German, English is not very good. German is also a "super" word and English pronunciation is very similar. First listen to her when I thought she was speaking English, I was very surprised English super is not very common, why she always talks about? Entered the room and found the room was very clean and everything was neatly placed. She also prepared a bath towel, bathrobe, hair dryer, shampoo, etc. for me. She made breakfast is also very good (compared to other people in Europe and America to do the dishes). Breakfast varieties is extremely rich, as much as three-star hotel breakfast. When I check out to say goodbye, she also specifically on the spot with google translate German translation of "bon voyage" to bless me. Two and along with her, I feel really science and technology to make the world smaller, and I found that when the language barrier is no longer a problem, the human heart from different countries to become closer.
</p>
<p>
After leaving Zurich, I went to Lucerne (also called Lucerne). This is a small town, all the famous sights on foot about three hours can be read. Because I had planned to stay there for two nights, so I chose to climb a mountain. The mountain is very well developed, there is a complete cable car, train systems, so many visitors choose the car up the hill. I first came to the foot of got lost, but fortunately met a grandfather looked like ready to climb, I went to ask for directions. Not a lot of signs hill, surrounded by almost no one in the mountain, the most important is that I finally found a can chat with the locals, so I resolutely decided to follow him all the way to climb. He has more than seventy years old, but completely not significantly older, people are very spiritual, Gajah in, looks like China 50 years old. Later I found out that in Switzerland, the 70-year-old is not old, but this is what happened later. We do not have any communication barriers, a young man he went to America to study civil read a master's degree, so English is very good. We talked all the way from comparative politics to travel, from car tax and then to the economic health care. I admire him, he has had more than 40 countries around the world, and still frequently travel. Around the World is one of my dream, I do not want to show off their own experiences to other persons around the world, nor is it to challenge their independence, I just want to see other countries, other peoples, other cultures, broaden their horizons . I think China as well, many of China's institutional, cultural, political, economic, etc., and Western society in China is not the same, a real understanding of the outside world is not easy, because there are various Chinese government demands the maintenance of stability, blocked out a lot of things, so we usually hear about are one-sided, it is treated. I like sitting in the bottom of a frog that, little is known. I want to know what the world is like. Man is like a day where a character says: if I can not know who I am, where I come from, I can try to understand all the information in the world, after that, I will be able to understand who I am. This is not the best analogy, but I want to say is, after Although I already have a comparative understanding of China into the system, but only if I've seen a lot of other countries, I can the Chinese have a more objective cognition.
</p>
<img src="Switzerland-hiking.JPG" alt="old grandfather" id="Switzerland_photo"/>
<p>
Back to the topic, the other grandfather went to the United States, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia. I asked him, Have you ever been so many countries, what is your favorite country? Results expected, he did not give me a clear answer. His answer was dialectical, just as American universities teach. In short, he believes that different countries have their own characteristics, not the best. He also told me that he was climbing a weekly exercise part of the program, he came here to climb twice a day. In addition, he also likes swimming. I like his healthy lifestyle. In contrast, China's elderly body more backward, seventy, eighty years old people have a wheelchair. My dad is a typical example. He graduated from college, after work is not how to exercise, and the total out socializing, smoking, drinking, unhealthy lifestyle. After the medical examination found the problem now, he wanted to start to lose weight, start a movement, but the body is not suited. Running on him a little breathless to gas. I think exercise is not an overnight thing, must become a way of life, but also a strong reason behind powered. When we climbed halfway up the mountain, we encountered an "old grandfather" and two middle-aged women. My first reaction was that two women are "old grandfather" of the family, helping him climb. Later I learned that they and the "old grandfather" is not together, more shocking is that the "old grandfather" already 97 years old! ! At first I guess he might eighties, and I go the same way that the grandfather also feel that "old grandfather" is a joke. But after repeatedly recognized, we found that actually he was 97 years old, he is also on the weekly climbing experience through newspapers. Honestly, I have not seen over ninety elderly several years, but have not seen up to 97 years' old grandfather. " Him apart, his ear is not very back, speak no problem, every week is entirely on their own climbing! Years but still left their mark on him, "old grandfather" the camel's back, a climb of ordinary people 5-6 hour mountain, he may need more than 10 hours. And by "old grandfather" grandfather and go the same way conversation, I found that the Swiss are very health conscious. Whether in developing or developed countries, national health is a very important topic. However, China is still in the food and clothing, food and clothing of the times, people only pay attention to whether or eat. But now for the urban residents, the food has been very rich, so the rate of obesity has risen. Although many people noticed his health problems, but they always find a variety of excuses not to exercise regularly. I think partly because people care more about the current income, so they spend more time to make money, but it is certainly not the only reason; on the other hand may be the young people do not care about the body, the body squandered the capital, only to know the old health importance.
</p>
<p>
Compared to other features of Switzerland, Switzerland's transport system has left me a deep impression. When I walked out of the train station in Zurich, I am looking for is a frequent bus and taxi queue waiting for passengers in and out of the picture. I thought there would be like Beijing West Railway Station as noisy hustle and bustle. However, the thing that catches my eye is the clean streets, neat and orderly and rail stations, trams across it. Compared to West Point, although Zurich Train Station is the largest train station, but the flow of people is still small. Tram in Zurich is very popular, because it is only electricity, so there is no black tail gas emissions. See Swiss transportation system, I finally understand what it was like in developed countries, the gap between developed and developing countries in which, more importantly, I saw Beijing to solve the haze method. Clean air is not the only benefit brought by tram. Because in orbit, almost no noise from the train, but does not that sounds like a fanfare when the vehicle grab Road. Whether downtown or the suburbs, the tram is the main means of transport, but there are also Swiss trolleybus as a supplement. In short, the Swiss transportation system is power-driven, which is currently the low-cost, environmentally friendly best choice. In contrast, in Beijing, I only remember the Qianmen Street, a short tram tracks, but that is only part of the Qianmen Street, tourist attractions, is a gimmick.
</p>
<p>
In addition to reflecting the wealthy Swiss high per capita income, it is also reflected in the high prices. I do not shop, so for me the most intuitive feeling comes from ticket and food prices. I go compared to other European countries, Switzerland, the ticket is indeed the most expensive. A common way for small ticket to 3-4 euros. Food is simply terrible. As I mentioned earlier, I live on the outskirts of Zurich, not too many places to eat. The landlord told me that only one restaurant within walking distance. The restaurant Azeri many, many locals. Waiter looks very professional. The only good place is a lot of flies, I feel there is not very clean. I remember that I only ordered a main course and a bottle of soda as my dinner. Checkout, I was surprised to find that the bill turned out to be 42 euros! It was the most expensive in Europe, I eat a meal, and I really did not eat anything. But I vaguely remember what I ordered pork (or chicken?) Is really good to eat.
</p>
<p>
Switzerland, the United States is the natural beauty. I like urban planning in Switzerland. I went to two cities have a lake, next to the city was surrounded by mountains, the lake has a naive swan mountain has lush greenery. One might argue that Switzerland chose a good place. However, this is to protect the natural Swiss undeniable. A child, I thought that developed countries "developed" reflected in the high level of industrialization, the city is reflected in the factory buildings, smoke billowing, pedestrians hurry. However, Switzerland is a good counter-example. Although Switzerland has industry, the watchmaking industry, finance, tourism is a pillar industry in Switzerland. Compared to industry, the latter three industry is a typical environment-friendly industries. Such national industrial structure makes the Swiss city can live in harmony with nature. Cities in Switzerland is not leveled trees grassland, which is built on bare land the city, it is more like Natural Urban, homeopathy and built cities.
</p>
<p>
Swiss sky is blue is blue, a lot of very green trees in Switzerland. However, all it came so naturally, when I was living in when that kind of environment, I actually did not notice the sky is so blue, the trees are so green. Only when I return home, back to that Beijing was shrouded in haze, I suddenly found that the Swiss sky is blue, tree lot, where I should stay for a while more, and enjoy a rare natural time to spend. This is a natural person, our ancestors had lived in nature, in the forest. We are part of nature, rather than a natural dominator, ruler. When we returned to nature, we will feel relaxed, feel pleasure, there is a feeling of returning home. This is, of course, because we come from this is natural. For deforestation behavior is still happening every day now, I feel it is a pity. Although people on the ground can be reclaimed after the planted crops and built the city, but that they lost the opportunity to get along with nature, lost the opportunity to "home".

<div id = "Austria">
<h2><ul><li>Austria</li></ul></h2>
<p>
Before coming to Austria, I know very little about Austria. Vienna but I have some understanding of what it is the music capital. Austria I guess I know a very special country, because I'm generally a country better than specific city. Although I know that Vienna is the music capital, but I can not tell the names of a few musicians in Vienna, you can say it's only the Musikverein in Vienna.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, I did not feel much of Salzburg and Vienna musical elements, did not feel there was music of the country, only occasionally seen a few street music artists on the street, nothing more. If Austria or Vienna, compared with Paris, Paris subway station music player actually more. However, after I visited a lot of museums, palaces, the more that Paris is very special, subjective to say, Paris is too good, so the comparison with other cities Paris, somewhat unfair.
</p>
<p>
But a city's music scene certainly can not just be determined from the number of street artists, street performers, after all, belong to the folk music of the music level, compared to professional concerts, opera, there are still gaps. I was fortunate to have enjoyed the music of a Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute." Apart from the opera itself, local Viennese audience gave me left a deep impression. Although the site says the dress code recommends that a formal dress, but did not say if you wear a vest and jeans, you can not enter the opera. Since I did not bring suits, wearing a long-sleeved plaid shirt and casual trousers went to see the opera. After that night from the subway station and saw people flock to the Opera House are dressed: men with a standard suit, ladies dress is beautiful, even the children, too. It can be seen that the importance of the Viennese opera, respect and basic literacy. Another point can prove Viennese music literacy is higher when watching the opera almost no one to chat, sleep, and people know when to applaud, even cheering. Although I was a weekday rather than a weekend to go, but the whole opera house was packed, visible Viennese love of opera, music. In addition I went Volksopor, there are a number of Vienna opera house, many of them 19th-century opera house frequented by royalty and nobility.
</p>
<p>
In Austria as in Switzerland would not be so lucky, in addition to the hotel front desk and talk to people, I only talked to one or two local people. Salzburg have time to eat dinner, I bring a bottle of water as usual, because Europe does not provide free tap water like the United States, and their tap water, filtered water is not cheap. But that was when I drink waiter found out, he would not let me bring their own drinking water. He and I talk a bit, he helped me pick up a cup of water, free of charge. He deliberately and I said that he was against the rules to do so, please do not tell me his boss. He also took the initiative to help me with the English translation of the menu. In addition, we (At this point, I have school and study tours confluence) when playing in Vienna, we found that there is also a public bike rental system. We tried to get to know how car hire, a sister eagerly for us to explain nearly five minutes. In fact, she is to rent a bike to go home, but she helped us. I felt so warm. Maybe Salzburg restaurant waiter and sister who do not know they left me with the impression that constitute my whole impression of this large group of people in Austria: friendly, enthusiastic, nice. Vice versa, maybe they will think all Chinese people seem to like me now.
</p>
<p>
Before going to Austria, I have not learned much about its history. In that play more than a week, and now came back, I still know very little about its history. Let us talk about Vienna, it seems to have been in the history of Austria in this area is a very important city, before a king ruled. In retrospect, I do not remember any of a king's name. European history there are too many kings, but to count the number, but some kings also ruled several places simultaneously. In Europe this land, I am familiar with Charlie, Henry the French monarchy. Speaking in Austria, compared to the king, a queen for my name's impressed that Sissi. Before my mother and I said, there was Austria Sissi, Sissi I also saw a special exhibition at the palace when visiting Vienna. Later, when the tour Schonbrunn Palace, the queen who was found not called Sissi, at least it was not her original name.
</p>
<img src = "Austria-Salzburg.JPG" alt="Salzburg" id = "Austria_photo"/>
<p>
Overall, Salzburg and Vienna is not large. May be compared to the Swiss city of Vienna, considered the big cities, but compared to Paris, Berlin, Munich, they are too small.

German or German have very distinct characteristics. Whenever a foreigner talking German, they always say in unison German very strict. Some people will do to extend this feature, but it is nothing but good things made in Germany, German time like "rigorous" branch of this feature. First, it is not accurate. Because even describe a person, can not be summed up with one or two adjectives, let alone a nation, a country. German himself does not like it extremely simplified description; secondly, it is very sad. Because the Germans must have other advantages or features, but they are rigorous characteristic too bright, its light overshadowed the other features of light emitted. In contrast, the Chinese people feel about the Japanese is more blurred. Some people think they love the clean, high quality; some people think they are advocating militarism, not introspection; some people think their bestial side very prominent. Why, people can use a German word summary, can not summarize a Japanese word? I think the difference is not only to highlight the extent of their different characteristics, we evaluated the objectivity of other nations also depends on our level of understanding of them. Japan, after all, our neighbors, and they invaded China, even more ironic is that the Japanese now appear in virtually every television show, so the Chinese people's understanding of their much more comprehensive point, if not more objective words.

It is undeniable that, before I went to Germany for the Germans also feel too one-sided, are some of the stereotypes. I heard that German punctuality, good German-made quality of industrial products, for preciseness. Perhaps because I have these stereotypes, during my Germany, a special attention, I would like to verify heard German characteristics of these is true. In fact, the Germans are not so punctual. For example, I sat on the bus a few times, and I always advance check bus arrival times on Google Maps, but there are at least 3-4 times, cars are late. The longest time was delayed about 4 minutes. Perhaps my German is too demanding. Think of it, often because the bus stop passengers up and down, it is difficult in full accordance with the timetable. I heard that German trains depart almost never late. I have not been in the train, so I also difficult to trace. I did not really buy anything industrial products in Germany. I just bought some bottle opener, knife such small items as souvenirs. Because I did not use these things, so I do not know if the quality is really as good as legends. But as circumstantial evidence, I do see a lot of famous car manufacturer's logo at Germany, they are in Germany: BMW, Mercedes, Audi. These are world-renowned car, luxury cars, so these brand fame can indirectly prove German industrial levels. Although I spent about three weeks in Germany, I do not know a lot of German. Most say that the exchange had to count my German class assistant, a long-term living in the United States, German. Indeed, unlike other serious or cheerful personality as easy to observe, but I still think a quick example. In Berlin, I went for pizza and the assistants, two professors and other students. When the closing dinner, as usual, we press the US AA checkout system that everyone pay their own money to eat. But even got enough money has been extra money on the bill, but tipping is not enough. In Germany, people used to give a 5% -10% tip. My TA is calculated should be given a special tip on the phone with a calculator and make up with their own money. I think China has a tradition of tipping if the people in the past that occasion will be mixed. Overall, our view of the Germans, some correct, some incorrect; but the German's characteristics simplistic certainly not objective.

If you write a history book in Germany, it must be long-winded, because so many things happened in German history. I've watched a documentary called "great nation", which will define history as a German division and history combined. Germany on land previously many small nations, until the emergence of some great, big Germany as a country. Germany to participate in a war in 1914; in 1933, the Nazis came to power, from going to war; in 1945, the defeat of Germany, Berlin was divided into four parts; in 1949, the East German government was established; in 1961, something the division of Germany; East and West Germany in 1990 merge. The above is a minimalist German modern history. But not difficult to see Germany experienced a lot of war and division. I'm curious about is: What is causing German interwar become major participating countries? What is driving the rapid revival in Germany after every war? I suspect they may be related to the Germans themselves, such as their national pride.
</p>
<p>
For the two world wars, the Germans did not give the same attention. Apparently, they pay more attention to the Second World War. May be due to the time of World War II occurred closer wounds caused by German mind has not healed. Next, I will talk about German war for reflection, too, it is a reflection of World War II and more. Speaking of World War II, I had put it out of the victim only Jews. Of course, I know that at the time of Hitler's conquest of Europe, and certainly there are a lot of innocent people were killed, but I do not know their identity. The study-tour in Germany, I learned that there are many Gypsies, the disabled, the mentally deficient people, homeless people, homosexuals were killed. However, they did not kill any high-sounding reason, just because they are "anti-social", the society does not work. I was shocked. Hitler even gave life price tag, with his own narrow values as the basis for many disenfranchised people alive.
</p>
<p>
After World War II, Germany was divided. I only know that before Germany was divided into East and West Germany, East Germany by Soviet control. I guess inevitable GDR is a socialist country like the Soviet Union. However, I only know China is a socialist country, and I dare not assert that all socialist countries are of a kind. I went to the GDR Museum, which exhibits all about the daily life of the people in East Germany. Their life is very boring, living under surveillance. Their economy is backward, planned economy. East Germany decades ago and it should be very similar to the Chinese.
</p>
<p>
German's ability to reflect people worthy of respect. Junior high school history class, I have studied, "Warsaw kneel." It is said that when he was West German Chancellor Willy Brandt in Warsaw's former Jewish Monument to kneel. Some people say he is the emotions, spontaneous knees; some people think this is planned before. Either way, he the knees, because of his special status, on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany or the German nation for Poland, the apology for the Jewish people. Foreign critics also wrote: "He did not need to kneel down, but he should kneel and for those who did not kneel, kneel."
</p>
<p>
German introspection of the war is also reflected in their museum, monument. I went to the War Museum in Munich, Berlin's Jewish Museum, Jewish monuments, Gypsies Memorial, Memorial victims and so on. German introspection of history beyond my imagination. Most of the monuments in Berlin I went to the museum in the vicinity of the Brandenburg Gate, Unter den Linden, which is the center of Berlin. From the perspective of urban planning perspective, the premium should be outward from the center was decreasing radioactivity. Thus, in theory, it should be the downtown shopping center, business center, because of the high profits of these buildings, can afford to pay the rent. Obviously, the monument is not profitable, they are all free and open to the public; even the museum for a fee, tickets are very cheap, compared to the daily operating expenses museum, it must be to make ends meet. So why the German government but also to these monumental buildings built in the center of it? They want to remind the Germans, to remind them that the crimes they have committed, the damage. In addition, I think they also wanted to give foreigners have set a historical reflection of the spirit of the German image. Because this type of construction is too much, I even think that the Germans want to show off their remorse. It sounds a bit ridiculous, because the Germans to reflect on history is not glorious, but their attitude is absolutely commendable, so it can show off. In contrast, I prefer the Japanese government to show off their remorse.
</p>
<p>
German monument is the best I've ever seen the monument. Before talking about German monuments, we can first compare the Chinese and American monuments. China mostly tall monument on, sometimes accompanied by one or a group of giant statue. All in all looks very shocked, but did not name the individual monuments, sometimes only one sentence was outlined. US monument better. Although Obelisk their SAR nor the individual's name, but the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 9-11 Memorial are inscribed with the name of each victim. This is very important because it is the respect for life. Who is and who is not exactly the same, so there is absolutely not just a monument with a perfunctory "in commemoration of soldiers who died in xx." Even after a hundred years, rarely someone might recognize the name on the monument, but at least now, the families of the deceased to find their loved ones name, this is a much consolation ah! Finally talk about German monuments. East Germany is still a relatively poor, built a lot of heroic, tall monument on, because those monuments inherited the Soviet socialism. But the Germans also have their own unique monument. This monument has gone beyond this level of history remembered, and reached a level convey emotion. Indeed, respect for the individual is important, but for ordinary tourists, a few days later, they certainly can not remember any name. If the Monument to let them remember the monument commemorating the emotions felt by people at the time, which will be retained in their hearts for a long time. This is the German monument gave me the feeling. Convey a feeling of history is not easy, the Germans choose to use the building to convey. I went to the "Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe" and "Jewish Museum" in the "Holocaust Tower" is such a monument and memorial.
</p>
<p>
"Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe" is a monument to the group. Not so much a monument, as it is a cement pillar. From a distance, the memorial complex is a highly similar composition of cement pillars, from near and far, and gradually increase the height of the column, and then farther to the other side, the height of the column and drop down. In short, the buildings from the outside is very abstract. If this and deliberately murdered Jews build relationships, it can only be a pillar of the Jews on behalf of a victim, but this is not the best explanation, because only a two hundred pillars, far less than the millions of persecution the number of Jews. Slowly walked in, only to find that the ground is not smooth, undulating. So in some low-lying land, the far outside post to see tall. When walking inside, I can not concentrate at the side of the column, we must also pay attention to the foot of the ground. I think this may be one of the architects wanted to convey the feelings of the Jews was felt every day of uncertainty and fear. In addition, each column and other columns are separate, so my eyes are also side pillars blocked. That is, each through a column, I might hit came a line of sight from the other tourists dead. I felt the fear of the Jews daily mood. Jews living in Germany was walking on the edge every day, at any time they could be evicted from their homes or killed. Architect himself said before, he did not care a child playing on the pole, his solemn memorial buildings and other monuments different, his work is to resonate with people's minds.
</p>
<p>
"Holocaust Tower" was designed very simple, probably is a three-story black tower. Inside the tower without any complex structure, is completely open, and no windows. So dark tower, in addition to other visitors and myself, empty. As my professor said, sometimes nothing is built on the best way to commemorate the dead things. I think this tower is an example. Obviously, by name, I infer that commemorates the massacre of the Jews, because their presence was erased, Tarifa also corresponds to empty. But I want to improve my teacher's point of view, sometimes there is no need to show the existence of. Like the tower, the tower itself, if not, we know how this is to commemorate the life of it does not exist?
</p>
<p>
"Jewish Museum," there is a room left me a deep impression. It was a long narrow room, dimly lit inside, can not see the other end of the room. When not yet entered the room, I heard the sound of the collision sent the metal, after entered, found that people were crowded at the entrance of the room, holding the camera to shoot the other end. When I curiously looked down, I was shocked, there is indeed a metal object on the ground, is made of a sheet metal face, face very painful. There are a lot of faces on the ground, piled several layers. There are two people to walk on, every step of the foot and face to face collide screech. Only two people dare to walk on. Of course, the museum does not prohibit people walking on it, but most people still choose to end photography. The room was quiet, only the strident voice echoed in the room. I think that's murdered Jews soul screams. I do not want to disturb the soul of the tragic fate of those victims, so I did not walk up.

German beer, world-renowned. Germany has a wide variety of Oktoberfest, the most famous Munich Oktoberfest. I also heard on the streets of the German white-collar workers can often be seen sitting in the street of the "stall", gulp beer scene. However, it appears this is a rumor, it can be said to be exaggerated. I did not see the street food stalls. But everywhere the beer garden. The so-called beer garden is open-air restaurant, more casual. People can drink in there big mouth, big mouth to eat meat. Their beer mug can also be confirmed from the side of the Germans drink beer. Beer garden only two kinds of wine glasses, one is 500ml, one is a 1L.

<p>
In addition to wine, Germany has some of their own specialty foods, such as sausages, pork knuckle. I tasted several times ELBOW, not very much. Probably because the meat dish is the culmination of a masterpiece, but I was a love bite is better than people who eat meat. If the German pork knuckle in a Chinese restaurant on the plate, occupies the entire plate. They also unlike some as cloying upscale Chinese restaurant, and their flesh are genuine, I think one is enough for me to eat at least two meals ELBOW. However, the dish is not only a ELBOW, they are still on the edge of the plate accompanied by mashed potatoes made two balls. There is also a small dish of appetizers. And I went with Chinese friends like this. I can not eat when you ask him for help, he was always able to make a pork shoulder into two bones clean in a short time. He and I ate together many times, as long as the restaurant ELBOW, he will basically point, but even a ELBOW enthusiasts like him, he spent nearly a month in Germany after also no longer eat pork knuckle a. After all, our stomach is still used in Chinese cuisine. There are very famous German sausage. Sausage itself is not very special, bulky, slightly salty. But the Germans eat sausage like dipping sauce, dip them in the sauce is mustard. In short heavier taste. Compared sausage, they have a taste of heavier food, a bread, like asking Pretzel. This should be the bread an elongated bread rolled into each other end to end staggered ring studded with many large salt. Bread itself is tasteless, but the bite is very salty, a mouthful of salt. I prefer light food. I found that after such a pretzel flavors of food and had a knife put the above salt picked off. I do not eat a second time to eat. But this also happens bread is very popular in Germany, each has bakery, and sometimes can not find other food, can barely buy it to eat.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we must mention the German love of football. As we all know, Germany has one of the best soccer clubs in the world - Bayern Munich. German national team in the last World Cup to clinch the World Cup. Germany has a very strong football culture, often can be seen on the street wearing the German national team or Bayern jersey people. Before I go to Europe to watch a ball game has been a desire in Germany, but then I asked to be German Bundesliga before I went to Germany to the end of the season. Luckily, my roommate accidentally found on the Internet, we can look to Berlin a Berlin native with a Premier League team friendlies. I am very surprised that, despite Berlin's dog team is not very good, it was not an official game, but the stadium was packed, and most people chose the arrangement region, that is to say, people always stood with their team to refuel. When we approach the game to begin, and we did not see the players when the team heard the song and the sound of deafening slogan, which shows the good German football culture. The game, the fans cheering and singing voice is also one after another, endless. The ride back, I saw a good few printed team logo that sticks Berlin passing car; tram is basically fans, still holding cheer props.
